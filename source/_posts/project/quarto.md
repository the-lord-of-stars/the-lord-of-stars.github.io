## Introduction

During the past 6 months, I have been working on developing a new version of Quarto template for DATA Curriculum. This project is a collaborative effort between the DATA team and the Quarto team at the Center for Open Science.

## Development
This version is based on the previous version of Jupiter Bookdown template. The main changes are:
- The template is now based on the latest version of Quarto (0.2.10).
- The template is now designed to be used with the DATA Curriculum.
- The template is now more modular and easier to customize.
- The template is now more consistent with the DATA Curriculum.
- The template is now more accessible and easier to use for non-technical users.
